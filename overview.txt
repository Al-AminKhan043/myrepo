Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to large projects with speed and efficiency. It tracks changes in source code, enabling multiple developers to collaborate seamlessly. With Git, you can create branches to work on different features independently and merge them back when ready. It ensures code integrity with its unique SHA-1 hash algorithm, making every change traceable and secure. Key operations include cloning repositories, committing changes, and pushing to remote repositories like GitHub. Git's flexibility, performance, and robust branching model have made it an industry-standard tool in software development and version control.
